# rtnormC

Random samples from a doubly-truncated Normal distribution.

This repository contains a C translation of the
[C++ code](http://miv.u-strasbg.fr/mazet/rtnorm/rtnormCpp.zip) of
G. Dolle and V Mazet.

In [another repository](https://github.com/alanrogers/dtnorm), I
provide modified code, which is faster, and which I have tested more
thoroughly than the code provided here.
